## Lyrics

### Verse

Here it comes

Ain't this some shit?

You see that box on the desk

With my name written on it

It's filled with my things

I've been set free

I have

Yes

Indeed

I have

Oh

I got some time now

Finally

I got some time now

### Pre-Chorus
Yeah

Yeah

And I said to myself

### Chorus
I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I said

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

While I'm awake

### Verse 2
So I walk out

The front door

And I'm free to be

And my head's held high

Ain't a damn thing wrong with me

I'm singing

"Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye"

This time I mean it

Too

Oh

You ain't gotta worry about me

And if you do

I'll tell you one thing

Yeah

### Chorus
I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I said

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

While I'm awake

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I said

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

I am living the dream

While I'm awake

While I'm awake

### Bridge
Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye
