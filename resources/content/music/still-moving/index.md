## Lyrics
### Verse 1 (soft piano + vocal)
Been down roads with no clear ending,
Dreams ran dry, but I kept chasing.
Every fall felt never-ending,
But somehow I kept my faith in me.

### Pre-Chorus (light percussion and pad lift)
They said, “slow down, you’ll burn out fast,”
But I was made to make it last.

### Chorus (full pop drums, bass, and synths — anthem feel)
I’m still moving, still proving,
When the world says no, I keep pushing through it.
Every scar’s a story that I’m using,
To light my way — yeah, I keep choosing.
The road gets rough, but I keep grooving,
‘Cause I’m still here… still moving.

### Verse 2 (soft piano + vocal)
Late nights, doubt keeps whispering,
“Maybe you’re not meant to win.”
But even when my hands start trembling,
I hold the line, I breathe again.

### Pre-Chorus (light percussion and pad lift)
It’s not the wins that make you strong,
It’s fighting when it all feels wrong.

### Chorus (full pop drums, bass, and synths — anthem feel)
I’m still moving, still proving,
When the world says no, I keep pushing through it.
Every scar’s a story that I’m using,
To light my way — yeah, I keep choosing.
The road gets rough, but I keep grooving,
‘Cause I’m still here… still moving.

### Bridge (piano and vocal only, swelling to final chorus)
Maybe one day I’ll look behind,
And see the mountains I’ve climbed.
But for now I’m living line by line,
Step by step, still chasing time.

### Final Chorus (huge, cinematic re-entry with harmonies and vocal ad-libs)
I’m still moving, still proving,
When my heart breaks down, I dance right through it.
Every tear’s a fire that I’m fueling,
To light my way — yeah, I keep choosing.
The road gets tough, but I keep grooving,
‘Cause I’m still here…
Still moving.

### Outro (emotional fade on “Still moving…” echoing in reverb)
Yeah, I’m still here… still moving.
