## Lyrics
### Verse 1:
Woke up muddy from a dragon dream,
Grass in my hair and jam on my knee!
Mom said, “Hey now, it’s time to clean,”
Let’s fill the tub—it’s a bathtime scene!

### Chorus:
Splish splash, bubble bash,
Rubber ducky's doing a cannon crash!
Wash my arms, wash my nose,
Scrub my fingers and my toes!
Splish splash, scrub-a-doo,
I’m the cleanest kid—how 'bout you?

### Verse 2:
Shampoo hat on my foamy crown,
Scrub-a-dub-dub till the dirt goes down.
Water swirls like a magic spell,
I’m squeaky clean and I smell so well!

### Chorus:
Splish splash, bubble bash,
Soap parade and a sponge mustache!
Rinse my ears, rinse my chin,
Make sure I get behind the skin!
Splish splash, scrub-a-dee,
Being clean feels great to me!

### Bridge:
Germs like hiding where you can’t see,
So scrub-a-dub smart, and you’ll be germ-free!
Don’t forget elbows, knees, and feet,
Bathtime’s how we stay fresh and neat!

### Final Chorus:
Splish splash, bubble bash,
Bathtime’s over in a splashy flash!
Wrap me up, towel hug,
Time to chill in my cozy rug.
Splish splash, I had a blast,
Can’t wait ‘til the next bath bash!
