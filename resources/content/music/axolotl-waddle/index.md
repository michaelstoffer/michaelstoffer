## Lyrics
### (Verse 1 â€“ Meet the Axolotl!)
"Deep in the water, where the rivers flow,"
"Lives a little creature that you might not know!"
"A big wide smile and feathery hair,"
"A squishy little body that wobbles everywhere!"

### (Chorus â€“ Axolotl Waddle Dance! ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ)
"Wiggle to the left, wiggle to the right!"
"Swish your tail and hold on tight!"
"Hop up once, then sink down low,"
"Thatâ€™s the axolotl waddleâ€”here we go!"

### (Verse 2 â€“ What Makes Them Special?)
"Axolotls never grow up, oh wow!"
"They stay little babies, even now!"
"They can regrow a leg, a tail, or two,"
"Like a real-life magic trickâ€”who knew?"

### (Chorus â€“ Axolotl Waddle Again! ðŸŽ¶)
"Wiggle to the left, wiggle to the right!"
"Swish your tail and hold on tight!"
"Hop up once, then sink down low,"
"Thatâ€™s the axolotl waddleâ€”here we go!"

### (Bridge â€“ Axolotl Party! ðŸŽ‰)
"Pink ones, white ones, speckled and black,"
"All of them swimming in a happy pack!"
"They wiggle and giggle all through the day,"
"Doing the Axolotl Waddle their own fun way!"

### (Final Chorus â€“ Dance Party! ðŸ’ƒ)
"Wiggle to the left, wiggle to the right!"
"Swish your tail and hold on tight!"
"One last time, letâ€™s waddle and spin,"
"Axolotl funâ€”letâ€™s do it again!"
