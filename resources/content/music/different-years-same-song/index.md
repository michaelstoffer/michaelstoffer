## Lyrics

### INTRO
I’ve got a little more history in my hands,

But she makes me feel like I’m starting again.

### VERSE 1
She’s city lights, I’m a small-town slow,

But we meet in the middle and the whole thing glows.

They look at the gap like it’s something to fear,

I look at her smile and it’s crystal clear.

I don’t talk too loud, I don’t move too fast,

I just keep it steady, let the good things last.

If the world wants a reason, they won’t get one from me—

’Cause love doesn’t ask for a receipt.

### PRE-CHORUS
Let ’em say what they say, we’ll be fine,

I’m not here to rush her—she’s not here to rewind.

When she takes my hand, everything feels right,

Like the noise fades out and the room turns light.

### CHORUS
Different years, same song—same song,

They count the candles, we count the sparks all night long.

I’m a little older, she’s a little new,

But I never make her feel like she’s got something to prove.

Different years, same song—hold on,

Right where we belong… right where we belong.

### POST-CHORUS
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh—same song (same song)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh—all night long (all night long)

### VERSE 2
I’ve got old photos, she’s got brand-new plans,

I’ve got calm in my chest, she’s got fire in her hands.

She brings the color back into my days,

Like the sun found my window and decided to stay.

I don’t “save” her, she don’t “fix” me,

We just fit easy, like it’s meant to be.

And when she doubts it, I pull her close and say,

“Baby, you’re safe with me—always.”

### PRE-CHORUS 2
Let ’em call it a thing, let it roll off our skin,

They don’t know what it’s like when the quiet kicks in.

She can take her time, I’m not going anywhere,

I’ll be right here—steady as prayer.

### CHORUS
Different years, same song—same song,

They count the candles, we count the sparks all night long.

I’m a little older, she’s a little new,

But I never make her feel like she’s got something to prove.

Different years, same song—hold on,

Right where we belong… right where we belong.

### POST-CHORUS
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh—same song (same song)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh—all night long (all night long)

### BRIDGE
Maybe I’ve got time etched into my face,

But I’ve got nothing but gentle for her to taste.

If the world’s too loud, I’ll turn it down,

Lay my jacket on her shoulders, walk her through the crowd.

No pressure, no proving, no running away—

Just me and her heart, and the slow good way.

### FINAL CHORUS
Different years, same song—same song,

They count the candles, we count the sparks all night long.

I’m a little older, she’s a little new,

But I never make her feel like she’s got something to prove.

Different years, same song—hold on,

Right where we belong… right where we belong.

Same song… me and you.
