## Lyrics
### Verse 1:
Good morning, time to rise,
Open up those sleepy eyes!
Stretch your arms, wiggle your toes,
Let’s get dressed—here we go!

### Chorus:
Shirt on my feet? Oh no, not neat!
Pants on my head? That’s not what Mom said!
Oops, my hat’s on my knee,
Somebody help me, please!

### Verse 2:
Socks go where? Oh, on my feet!
Shoes go on? Not on my seat!
Jacket goes on—zip it up tight,
Now we’re ready—looks just right!

### Chorus:
Gloves on my ears? That’s kinda weird!
Shoes on my hands? I look like a deer!
Oh no, my scarf’s in my sleeve,
Somebody help me, please!

### Verse 3:
Hat on my head, gloves on just right,
Pants on my legs—now I look bright!
Jacket zipped up, shoes nice and neat,
Now I’m ready—time to move my feet!

### Final Chorus:
Shirt on my tummy, socks on my feet,
Hat on my head—now I’m looking neat!
No more mix-ups, hip-hip hooray!
I’m ready for an awesome day!
